        Welcome to Grab Your Mat <span class="fw-light h3">(Yoga studio with a difference)</span>
      </h2>
      <p class="h4 fw-light">
        Our goal is to help you reach an enhanced state of awareness and union with all, and that is where yoga practice in our studio comes into play.  You become more aware of your mind, body and breath and learn to coordinate them.  Meditation helps you to become more aware of your surroundings resulting in oneness with the universe.
      </p>
      <p class="h4 fw-light">
        Through the physical practice of asanas (poses) and pranayama (breathing practices) we become aware of the spiritual path of yoga.  A clean body and mind is something that is of prime importance to reach more awakened states of consciousness and the eight limbs of yoga help us get there.
      </p>
      <p class="h4 fw-light">
        We aim to provide a safe, effective, customized and enjoyable yoga practice for people of all ages and levels of fitness.  A range of practice options is available to ensure gradual development of strength, flexibility, balance and relaxation.
      </p>
      <p class="h4 fw-light">
        We also organize workshops, corporate classes, retreats designed to explore different aspects of yoga practice and how it can be used to shape and enhance our daily lives.
